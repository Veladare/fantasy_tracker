## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to create a mysql employee tracker to organize my business by creating mysql tables that store data about my workers. 

In completing this assignment, I learned how to use the mysql commands of SELECT, INSERT, WHERE, UPDATE, and JOIN to create various tables to display my departments, roles, managers, and employees. I obtained a greater understanding in how to use the map method to display preexisting departments, roles, and managers while users use inquirer. 

## Installation 

To use, install npm, inquirer (version 8.2.4), mysql and inject seed data from the terminal in VScode or similiar programs if users wish to inspect the code.

## Usage

After installing requisite packages and inject seed data, users type in the command node index.js in the terminal. After this users may navigate the program as they wish.
